# Giulia Paggiola professional profile site

A Github repo for [giuliapaggiola.com](http://giuliapaggiola.com).
The website is built with Grunt, Handlebars and Compass.

### Development & deploy
The site development heavily relies on Grunt task runner.
All Handlebars templates found in `/src` are processed and built in HTML by [Assemble](http://assemble.io/), while the live site is then updated with [Gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-gh-pages).
