					<h4>
						Chemistry YES competition - Young Entrepreneurs Scheme
					</h4>
					<p>
						In a team of four from University of York, I've taken part in the regional ChemistryYES competition held in Manchester (UK) sponsored by BBSRC, RSC and NERC. It involved:
						<ul>
							<li>3-days training in business, IP, marketing and finance</li>
							<li>team-working ahead of and during the event for building a business plan around a chemistry related commercial idea</li>
							<li>pitching our business idea to fictionary investors (ChemistryYES judges)</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>
						Research Placement at CatSci Ltd
					</h4>
					<p>
						I've independently carried out a short project in a private business environment where I've received training on the site laboratory facilities, especially on automated technology for performing high-throughput reaction screening.

					<h4>
						Summer project for Wella - Committed Beyond Beauty
					</h4>
					<p>
						I've participated in a P&G corporate sustainability project aiming to reduce the environmental impact of hair salons. My contribution involved reporting specific practices of concern by observing the daily routine within a number of salons and discussing potential issues and improvements together with salons' owners.
						The observations were presented at P&G Headquarters in Geneva and made into a promotional video and handbook.
